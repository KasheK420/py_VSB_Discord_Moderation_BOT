## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

### 1. Source Code

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

### 2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source.

### 7. Additional Terms

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

### 8. Termination

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors.

### 11. Patents

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.

### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work.

### 14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.

### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

### 16. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES.

### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program.

## Additional Permissions

### Discord Bot Token Exception

As an additional permission under section 7 of the GPL v3, you are permitted to use your own Discord bot token and API keys when running this software, without being required to disclose those tokens under the source code distribution requirements of this license. Bot tokens and API keys are considered configuration data, not part of the source code.

### Database Content Exception

Database content created by users of this software (including but not limited to user data, messages, configurations, and other runtime-generated content) is not considered part of the Program and is not subject to the GPL license terms.

## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program:
